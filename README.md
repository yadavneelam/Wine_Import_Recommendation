# Wine_Import_Recommendation
Business Problem: To recommend country from where potential excellent wine with affordable price can be imported by client (Hotel TULIP)

# Background : 
Hotel TULIP has asked to analyze a wine rating dataset that includes different types of wine rated by WineEnthusiast over the world. As a data analyst I have explored the dataset and discovered :
1) 10 varieties of wine which receives the highest number of reviews
2) varieties of wine having the average price less than 20, with the average points at least 90
3) generated a statistic table, with country ,variety, avgpoints and avgprice
4) which country/countries would be recommended to Hotel TULIP to source wine from?

# Dataset
